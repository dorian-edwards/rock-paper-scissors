# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the Rock Paper Scissors project from the Odin Project's Foundations path. The [first iteration](https://github.com/buddafucofibas/rock-paper-scissors/tree/db39a7a5efd9b08e05768c10891bf56770fbc0d9) of this project plays five rounds of rock, paper, scissors, displays the winner of each round, and the final river.

The second [commit](https://github.com/buddafucofibas/rock-paper-scissors/tree/4a506c8baa05a2d7cfb1572ff82da5132862fae1) adds a UI and allows the player to play the CPU until there is a winner determined by the first to get five points.
